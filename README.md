# Activity 1.1.7

### This program draws an n-gon, with each side of the n-gon being a different color and having a different shape for the turtle pen (ex. arrow, triangle, turtle). This program is for anyone who wishes to be stimulated by little shapes being drawn across a screen or want to know the capabilities of the turtle module. This program is also for anyone who's interested in creating art or designs via the turtle module.
---

## Questions about the Activity as you work. 
```
- Are there more turtle shapes I can use to add more sides to the n-gon the turtle program is creating?
- Can I randomize the colors the turtle pen uses for each line created by said pen?
- Why is the shape of my turtle pen (ex. the arrow, the triangle, the turtle) black while its outlines are a different color?
- Is it possible to make a big n-gon with the turtle pen if my pen starts in a different place?
- Can I create a different shape (not an n-gon; ex. circle, triangle, semi-circle) with the given turtle program while also ensuring that each turtle pen shape (ex. arrow, triangle, turtle) are equidistant to each other?

```
